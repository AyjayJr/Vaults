## What is React.js?

- A javascript library for building user interfaces.
- All about building modern reactive user interfaces.

## Why React?

- Using just javascript requires you to write every single step that has to be taken
- React abstracts away some of the complexities of modern UI
- Declarative, component-focused approach

React is all about splitting your code into small components that have a clear task. The code remains maintainable and scalable. React handles the heavy lifting of combining your code together into a responsive webpage.

## Building Single-Page Applications with React

React can be used two ways:
- Control some parts of the HTML pages i.e. the widget approach
	- This requires the server to send and switch pages
- SPA approach, Server only sends one HTML page and React takes over control of everything
	- Gives the illusion of switching pages e.g. Netflix web app

## Alternatives to React

React is component based UI library. It lacks extra featuers that your app may need such as page routing that must be added via community packages.

Angular is another alternative that is also component based but ships with added features and uses TypeScript from the start. Can be overkill for smaller projects.

Vue.js another component based library that  includes more core features such as routing. A bit less popular than the other two.
