## My problem

I have been on a downward spiral for a while now.

I would contribute this to a number of things including:
1. My constant anxiety and rejection to do what is right
2. The copius amounts of media I am consuming e.g. doom-scrolling, youtube, twitch
3. My aversion to the future and working towards becoming a better person

## Issue #1
Why do I constantly have anxiety?
- Because I am not doing what I know I am supposed to be doing but don't want to do
- My state of learned helplessness that keeps telling me no matter what I do I won't be anything
- When I think of the schoolwork that I have to do and the consequences of me not doing said work

## Issue #2
Why do I consume so much media?
- To distract myself from the real issues at hand
- Addiction

## Issue #3
Why do I have an aversion to the future and working hard?
- Because I feel I will never achieve my dreams
- I feel I have the ability to be great but with the effort I put forward I won't amount to anything
- I only ever try just hard enough to get by never to achieve

## How can I fix these problems?

Need to consume books and resources that address these issues.

## Fix #1
1. Do what I know to be right to reduce cognitive dissonance
2. Restrict the amount of media that I consume on a daily basis
3. Work hard to become the person that I want to be

## Fix #2
1. Address the real issues
2. Learn more about how to combat an addictive personality

## Fix #3
1. I won't know if I don't try
2. Work harder, do what I know deep down needs to be done
3. I can and will achieve great things that I can be proud of
