i could thrive in a startup maybe?

but ok how am i doing right now?

I feel good i'm still on the same path as before.

I just took one day off that's all. I should be able to allow myself to at least have that at the very fucking least.

but i really gotta have a good understanding of the article that i'm supposed to be reading.

and also gotta finish my computer graphics final homework.

11/14
- read and outline article
- go to sd lab with these fuckers maybe
- but more importantly complete the computer graphics final
