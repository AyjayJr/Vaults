Definitely have to import my webdevbootcamp notes into here.

my page: https://potnet.neocities.org/
html elements: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element
css: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS

Centering a div in css:
```css
.center {
  position: fixed;
  left: 50%;
  top: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

What should I put on the page?
- About me
- Figure out how to make a good template
