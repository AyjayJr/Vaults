# Cracking The Coding Interview
Cracking the coding interview must be a good resource.

How should I go about studying that in order to extract the most amount of information in the shortest time?

- Couple bullet points on mutiple yt videos about the subject
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG0RhKFTonw&t=9s
		- Read the first chapter, has a lot of value
		- Read a few chapters that you think you are lacking information in
		- Read chapter on big oh notation
		- Read the section on hints for ds&a
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAxgzrj8zgU&t=1s
		- Core chapters are 1-5 and 7-10
		- DFS or BFS approach to the book? maybe BFS
