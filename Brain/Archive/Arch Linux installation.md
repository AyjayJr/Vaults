## First attempt was a failure

I'm having an issue with grub I think? Or at least with the /boot/efi folder.

I'm just going to restart the install from the beginning. Delete the partitions. Fresh install.

One question that I have is wether or not I use Legacy or UEFI?? and how to know if I'm using the right one.

I feel like that may be an issue if I create the partitions according to one when really I'm using the other.

## Status: Installed :)))

Ok so the problem the whole time was just that i didn't have efibootmgr installed.

silly me.

now i need to set up a gui of some kind if i want.

## Status: Installed with DWM

how do i run the programs in the menu bar??
