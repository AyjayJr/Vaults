## Components

React is all about components, all user interfaces are made up of components.

Components are resusable building blocks that use a combination of HTML, CSS, and JS.

This also allows us to separate our concerns and have separate components that handle a specific task.

React is written with a declarative approach meaning that you describe the desired target state and let react handle the actual JS DOM instructions.
