Made a couple of realizations on the phone today about how what I do is a self-fulfilling prohecy.

I don't try hard at the beginning and I'm aware I could be working harder.

Then at the end when I'm failing I say that I wasn't good enough to succeed.

Hello, we already know that I wasn't working hard in the beginning.

I didn't fail because I am a born failure, it is because I did not put my best foot forward.

Don't fool yourself.

You are worthy.
