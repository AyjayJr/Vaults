Going over some SQL stuff so that I am prepared for any questions about the technology that may come up in my interviews.

# Introduction

A database is a collection of data stored in a format that can easily be accessed.

SQL is a Database Management System (DBMS).

We send instructions to the DBMS and it will return the data from the Databased based on our instructions.

## Relational Databases

Information is stored in tables that are linked to each other using relationships.

Each table stores information about a specific type of object.
