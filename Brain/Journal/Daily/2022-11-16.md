Hollllyyyy hellll man. The grind is finally finished.

I'm gonna take the rest of tonight to do what i actually want to do.

Fuck SD2, Fuck School, I can't wait for it to all be over.

***It's all going to be worth it*** . . .

Ended up mopping up those 2 Robot Vision modules.

What to do, what to do?

Ok so after seeing the cost of these damn security courses i think i might just end up doing software engineer.

Gonna have to dedicate a certain amount of hours a day to studying the web development bootcamp.

and definitely start reading cracking the coding interview.
