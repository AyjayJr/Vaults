# Definition

Endianess is the order of bytes of a word of data in computer memory which describes the impact of the "first" bytes. There are two types, Big Endian and Little Endian.

## Big Endian (BE)

A Big Endian system stores the most significant byte of a word at the smallest address and the least significant at the largest.

## Little Endian

A Little Endian system stores the most significant byte at the largest address and the least significant byte at the smallest.

There are other types such as **Bi-Endian** or **Mixed Endian** which combine the two.
