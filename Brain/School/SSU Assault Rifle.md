Right now i'm just trying to be able to put the player in blank scene easily.
That is something about this project that needs to be cleaned up.
Especially the redundancy of the dual use of weapon controller for the gauss cannon.

Todo right now:
- get the player working in an empty scene ✅
- finish implementing the gun bob in the weapon controller ✅
- implement weapon swapping ✅
- add weapon sway to the gauss cannon ✅
- make gun not clip into objects ✅
- fix gauss cannon alignment when weapon sway is applied ✅

Ok gotta jump back into this now. Left off with good weapon switching and sway applied to all weapons.

Todo right now:
- cancel coroutines upon weapon switching to stop grapple bug ✅
- modify weapon script to allow for automatic fire for certain weapons ✅
- add bounce pad
