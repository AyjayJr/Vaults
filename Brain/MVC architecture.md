# Introduction

The three main features of a javascript framework are the following:
- Rendering
- Data handling
- Event handling
## Rendering

Rendering allows you to write templates for how you want your html to look and lets the framework evaluate the data for you.
## Data Handling

This allows you to place dynamic data in your templates and let the framework do the job of inputting the data. When the value changes the framework will re render the webpage to reflect those changes.

## Event Handling

This makes it easier to add event listeners to elements and respond to events. 

# MVC Architecture

1. Rendering => View
2. Data Handling => Model
3. Event Handling => Controller
