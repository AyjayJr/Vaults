### Memory

In assembly memory management is completely manual

One must load variables in to registers and keep track of which variables are in which register

### Paradigms

In most assembly languages '#' denotes a literal number and parenthesis indicate memory at this address

Each processor has a different language, thus it's difficult to move code from one to another
